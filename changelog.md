## 1.4.7

- [Add new module setting for show the companion list only to GM](https://github.com/theripper93/automated-evocations/pull/19)
- Replace icon 'fas fa-users' with 'fas fa-cat' on the actor header sheet button, because the 'fas fa-users' icon is used  from other modules and can create confusion.
- Add a little color to the header sheet button so is more intuitive
- Add module setting for remove the label from the sheet header button very useful for small monitor and mobile
- Add automatic github workflow for setup the releases with a gulp file builder (i think is best to have something like this ?)
